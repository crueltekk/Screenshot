# Screenshot
Automated Screenshots with selenium from specific website


This script just uses Selenium Webdriver to open up a website and makes a screenshot of it.

I started this to learn Python on my own way beside courses that I watch and try to complete.


Things I want to Implement:

	-	[still to work on] GUI
		- 23.11.21: Implemented little GUI to Choose wanted Webdriver and sets using webdriver
	- 	Completly customizable Values
	-	[check] Automatic Download of selected Webdriver
		- 23.11.21: Downloads now choosen webdriver from GUI to download if != exists
	
Maybe possible in the future (not yet my skillbase):

	-	Image Viewer for taken Screenshots
	-	WebApp from it
