# Screenshot
Automated Screenshots with selenium from specific website


This script just uses Selenium Webdriver to open up a website and makes a screenshot of it.

I started this to learn Python on my own way beside courses that I watch and try to complete.


Things I want to Implement:

	-	GUI [Not yet learned, but already tried Py
	- 	Completly customizable Values
	-	Automatic Download of selected Webdriver [ATM it juat downloads Chromewebdriver and uses it]
	- 
	
Maybe possible in the future (not yet my skillbase):

	-	Image Viewer for taken Screenshots
	-	WebApp from it
